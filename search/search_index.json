No data is shared with any 3rd parties outside of Discord and the users of the bot as part of normal usage. Usage Statistics and Logging The frequency that each command is used is recorded on a per-server level. Statistics in direct messages are not collected, and data is not linked directly to any user. Usage statistics are used to gauge usage and discoverability of commands, and to guide the implementation of new commands. Some commands may include additional logging. This includes timestamps, and the details of the command invoked, but not who used the command or where it was used. Preferences Users have the option to save personal preferences using the !setpref command. Saved preferences may be removed using the !clearpref command.
